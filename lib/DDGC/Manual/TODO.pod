[LOW PRIORITY!!! IGNORE FOR NOW] Account tooltips for the language are not
shown 
* the modal trigger elements lost their "data-reveal-id" info that tells JS
which modal to open.  also, there is a javascript error in jquery.reveal - 
could be a compatibility thing.  I think we should go back to my modified
version. -D - Cant we just use something else for them? or something more
simple? I dont like to "start" with a patched solution ;).....

On the userinfo inside a translation for example, there is still a "clickable"
arrow shown, even tho, that is not clickable (sometimes, sometimes it is).

In the comment html (templates_xslate/blog/post_comments.tx) the arrows to
vote for the comment, should be inside the box of the comment, instead of
next to it. Probably a bit of color would be cool.. like green arrow up
and red arrow down, or at least one example of both, so that i can set it
to visualize for the user what he voted on this already. Also the box need
some dropdown to pick the sorting algorythm, like sort by relevance, sort
by newest and so on. The "posted by" and the "about" should be removed, and
we need some "points" in that line for the voting result (or whatever place
if you have a better idea).
* green/red on hover, and if selected green/red permanently? - yes
** ok added .upvote and .downvote.  now if the user has voted you can add class 'voted' to the .voting wrapper, and .voted to the upvote or downvote
