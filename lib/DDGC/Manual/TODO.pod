Making the token domain language overview on translate/index hidden, load it
via ajax on request. Clicking on token domain leads then to language overview
instead of direct translation.

There is no visual difference between language the user speaks and the ones the
user doesnt speak. In favour of "hey lets look at other languages" i dont
wanted it limited to only the languages the user speaks. Also prevent display
of english language name on english languages ;).

Missing table design for admin area and general use for lists (sortable buttons
please).

Missing Error / Not Found page (default.tx, error.tx, error.tx must be independent, more simple HTML variant)

=head1 Design Errors

Tokenpage has space between the language dropdown/breadcrumb and the actual
token list.

Account tooltips for the language are not shown 
* these were in modal_tooltip.tx in provided files
