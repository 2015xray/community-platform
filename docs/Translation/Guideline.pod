=head1 BASICS

=head2 The translation interface

=head3 Intro

On L<the Community Platform|http://dukgo.com> you can translate the different 
text snippets of our sites. 
It's a very easy process, by choosing the project part you want to translate you 
get to a list of all existing text snippets, which you can translate step by 
step into your language, you can choose on the top right of the page. 
You can see existing translations on the right, important is here, 
that you don't need to give the same translation again, this would not 
be helpful and just increase your own work.

Please also vote on the translation for your language! You have the option 
to vote for the translation alternative to translate the token yourself. 
By default we only show you totally untranslated tokens (if there exist some), 
but you got a button there to see all tokens.

for, at least, one language you want to translate to. You have to select both of the :
