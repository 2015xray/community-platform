DuckDuckGo Community Platform Repository
========================================

In order to test this application on your own machine you require Perl installed, which is the case on nearly all Unix Systems. We don't
suggest trying to install on Windows, cause we don't test our application on this platform. The platform itself is tested and deployed always
on Debian stable. You need some packages on debian to install all Perl modules proper, just execute this as root:

  apt-get install build-essential libgd2-xpm-dev git

NOW WE DONT NEED ROOT ANYMORE!!!! DO ANYTHING ELSE WITH YOUR USERACCOUNT IN YOUR USERSPACE!!!!

We need to install local::lib, best is just following this instructions:

  wget http://cpan.cpantesters.org/authors/id/A/AP/APEIRON/local-lib-1.008004.tar.gz
  tar xvzf local-lib-1.008004.tar.gz
  cd local-lib-1.008004
  perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap
  make test && make install

After this you need to configure your shell to include the proper environment variables for
local::lib, you can do this for bash with this command:

  echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >>~/.bashrc

Best is now to relogin to be sure the variables are set, you can check it with this command:

  set | grep PERL5
  
You should get back some variables, if not, then you did something wrong ;). If you see the
variables, then you did anything probably and can now install Perl modules in your local
userspace. We now install first another CPAN client to install the modules:

  cpan App::cpanminus
  
After this you got the new command "cpanm" which is a much nicer way to install modules, we
need a small bunch of base modules to get our stuff best done:

  cpanm Dist::Zilla Catalyst::Devel

Now you can clone the repository of the platform:

  git clone git://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform.git
  
Then inside the repository you can install the requirements for authors and the requirements
of the distribution itself:

  cd community-platform
  cpanm $( dzil authordeps )
  cpanm $( dzil listdeps )
  
WARNING: Check for errors! In worst case, just redo both install commands, and you can see
them more clear!
  
When all requirements are installed we can deploy a small test setup for the environment:

  script/ddgc_deploy_dev.pl
  
And now you can start the web application with:

  script/ddgc_web_server.pl -r -d
  
-r means that it reloads on changes, and the -d means to activate the debugging.

Have fun!!!!!!!!
