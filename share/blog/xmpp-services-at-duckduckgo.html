<p>A small overview of what DuckDuckGo can offer you for also private communication over the well known opensource protocol XMPP.</p>
<!-- break -->
<h3>What is XMPP?</h3>
<p>XMPP or sometimes also called Jabber, is an open source instant messaging protocol which allows you to exchange instant messages with other users, like you know from ICQ, Yahoo, MSN or other chat software. The difference here is through the openness there are many different XMPP server and clients for you to use, but they all can communicate over this standard. If you are new to XMPP, just go to our other blog post about <a href="/blog/using-pidgin-with-xmpp-jabber">how to use Pidgin with our XMPP server</a>. There you get decent informations about how to get an account which you can use to communication with all other XMPP users in the world.</p>
<h3>I already got a XMPP account, what do you offer for me?</h3>
<p>Additionally to our own XMPP server, we also have a XMPP bot running at <b>im@ddg.gg</b>, who you can add as friend, he will instantly reply your friend request and you are able to drop a search query to him, and he will give you answers via XMPP. More feedback about this service are appreciated :).</p>
<h3>Why I should use XMPP?</h3>
<p>If you already use DuckDuckGo, you are already caring about your privacy, and all instant messaging services that you can access are driven by companies, who have full control about the messages you send. XMPP makes this harder, because no central company controls the servers, everyone has their own, and our XMPP server follows the same <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> as our search engine already follows, this means that your communication is secure, and will not be logged or tracked.</p>
