<p>In this Blog post I want to describe the community platform in several ways. Not only do I want to explain the technical details and how you can help contributing to it, I also want to show its possible future, and its historical background. I will also explain a bit of the business decisions behind it.</p>

<h3>What is the Community Platform?</h3>
<p>The idea for a Community Platform came together with the <a href="https://duck.co/topic/duckduckgo-s-new-public-xmpp-jabber-service-on-dukgo-com">XMPP server</a> we created for the community. With the XMPP server we had for the first time our own user list of fans and people who like DuckDuckGo. This allowed us to set up a web service on top of this user list, that allows the users to help us <a href="https://dukgo.com/translate">translate DuckDuckGo</a> into their language.</p>
<h3>What is the upcoming path?</h3>
<p>In the next step we still want to concentrate on the translation interface, and add more capabilities to let the user help us manage the translations. We need to be very fast here, because DuckDuckGo is rapidly growing with new features, and we want those features translated into all languages as fast as possible. A very tight coordination with the community, and a notification concept is very relevant here. Also, the voting needs tuning, because people went to vote bad translations, just because other translations were not there. This is not very helpful :). I already started to tune the quality of everything with writing a <a href="http://duckpan.org/perldoc/DDG::Manual::Translation">very detailed manual</a> about our translation infrastructure.</p>
<p>After this, we really need to add more features that integrate users in our process of spreading and extending DuckDuckGo. We want to build a custom plugin management system that allows a more detailed overview of the existing plugin projects and the upcoming projects. It will allow us to have several people, even not coders, help the process of adding more functionality to DuckDuckGo. But also the ability to manage user groups and coordinate the effort of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/spread">spreading DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>
<p>Also the integration of the so far outsourced <a href="http://duck.co">Forum</a> into the infrastructure is on the topic list. We want to allow the user to have a unified account to use all the community services of DuckDuckGo.</p>
<h3>What is the technology behind the community platform?</h3>
<p>One of the primary goals of the community platform is to be 100% open source. We try to write most parts with <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, because this is the main language used in most of DuckDuckGo, but, of course, we use always the best fitting technology, if there is a wider choice. Our XMPP server is <a href="http://prosody.im/">Prosody</a>, which is written in <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> and we use <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> as webserver. The servers are running on Amazon's EC2 services with <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/">RightScale</a> <a href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a> images. The <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> web framework we use is the <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst Web Framework</a>.</p>
<h3>And how can I help?</h3>
<p>There are several ways to help. New features for the Community Platform need several levels of engangement, like for example, an idea for the user interface, or the design of special elements, or especially a bit of code, of course :). But it all runs together as part of many ideas. Also, spreading DuckDuckGo and finding ways to help people spread DuckDuckGo is part of the Community Platform, and we will offer more and more features in that area, like user groups, in the near future. I hope we can offer more very easy ways to help in the near future :).</p>
