<p>In this Blog post I want to describe the community platform in several ways. Not only I want to explain the technical details, and how you can help contributing to it, I also want to show the possible future of it, and the historical background of it. Also I explain a bit of the business decisions behind.</p>

<h3>What is the Community Platform?</h3>
<p>The idea for a Community Platform was there together with the <a href="https://duck.co/topic/duckduckgo-s-new-public-xmpp-jabber-service-on-dukgo-com">XMPP server</a> we created for the community. With the XMPP server we had first time our own userlist of fans and people who like DuckDuckGo. This allowed us to setup a web service on top of this userlist, that allows the users to help us <a href="https://dukgo.com/translate">translate DuckDuckGo</a> into their language.</p>
<h3>What is the upcoming path?</h3>
<p>In the next step we still want to concentrate on the translation interface, and add more capabilities to let the user help us managing the translations. We need to be very fast here, because DuckDuckGo is rapidly growing with new features, and we want those features as fast as possible translated into all languages. A very tight coordination with the community, and a notification concept is very relevant here. Also the voting needs a tuning, because people went to vote bad translations, just because other translations were not there, this is not very helpful :). I already started to tune the quality of everything with writing a <a href="http://duckpan.org/perldoc/DDG::Manual::Translation">very detailed manual</a> about our translation infrastructure.</p>
<p>After this, we really need to add more features that allows the user to get integrated in our processes of spreading and extending DuckDuckGo. We want to build a custom plugin management, that allows more detailed overview of the existing running plugin projects and the upcoming projects. It will allow us to have several people, even not coder, help the process of adding more functionality to DuckDuckGo. But also the capability to manage user groups and coordinate helping to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/spread">spread DuckDuckGo</a>.</p>
<p>Also the integration of the so far outsourced <a href="http://duck.co">Forum</a> into the infrastructure is on the topic list. We want to allow the user to have a unified account to use all the community services of DuckDuckGo.</p>
<h3>What is the technology behind the community platform?</h3>
<p>One of the primary goal of the community platform, is to be 100% opensource. We try to work most parts with <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, because this is the main language used in most of DuckDuckGo. But, of course, we use always the best fitting technology, if there is a wider choice. Our XMPP server is <a href="http://prosody.im/">prosody</a> which is written in <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> and we use <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> as webserver. The server are running on Amazons EC2 services with <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/">RightScale</a> <a href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a> images. The <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> Webframework we use is the <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst Web Framework</a>.</p>
<h3>And how can I help?</h3>
<p>There are several ways to help. New features for the Community Platform need several levels of engangement, like for example, an idea of the user interaction, or the design of special elements, most of course a bit of code :). But it all runs together as part of many ideas. Also spreading DuckDuckGo and finding elements to help people spreading DuckDuckGo is part of the Community Platform, and we will offer more and more features in that direction, like Usergroups, in the near future. I hope we can offer more very easy ways to help in the near future :).</p>
