<p>The community platform has been given a fresh new look, and we'd like <em>your</em> help to keep making it better.</p>

<h3>Extending This Platform</h3>
<p>Care was taken to make this platform accessible and predictable when adding new features.  Want to add a button? <tt>&lt;a class="button"&gt;</tt> is all it takes!  Need it to be blue?  That's just <tt>&lt;a class="button blue"&gt;</tt>.</p>
<p>Need a two column layout? <tt>&lt;div class="half">Column1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="half"&gt;Column2&lt;div&gt;</tt> - no crazy grid wrappers needed, because floats are cleared at a <tt>.row</tt> level.  This "simple grid" was built to allow contributors to build out the platform without worrying about yet another syntax or trying to remember obscure grid classes and rules.</p>  
<p>There's obviously still a lot going on and a lot more examples we could give, but we're confident that this platform will be easy for new and experienced users to comprehend and extend as needed.</p>
<h3>A Friendly Translation Platform</h3>
<p>A key goal in this process was to make the experience of translating DuckDuckGo into your langauge a little more enjoyable.  There's still a lot of work to do to make DuckDuckGo more globally accessible, so we'd like to take this opportunity to ask for <em>your help</em> in <a href="/translate">translating DuckDuckGo into your language</a>.</p>
<h3>Designed for You</h3>
<p>This platform is for Community use, so if you notice something odd or you'd like to see something fixed, you can either <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/community-platform">roll up your sleeves and help</a>, or <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/feedback">let us know</a>!</p>
