<p>If you dont know XMPP/Jabber, you should checkout the WikiPedia page about it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP</a>. In general its a instant messaging service, like Yahoo Messenger, MSN, ICQ or Skype, to exchange messages live with other friends. As client we suggest <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>, but there are many more clients for every platform and on any device. A list you can get here: <a href="http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/clients/">http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/clients/</a>.</p>

<p>After downloading and installing Pidgin, you go through the following steps:</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/1_welcome.png" class="block mid" alt="Welcome screen of adding an account on Pidgin" />

<p>Here you just need to hit "Add..." to make a new account</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/2_addaccount.png" class="block mid" alt="Main add account " />

<p>On this menu you need to choose XMPP as protocol out of the dropdown. Then you can choose your username, you want on the server, your XMPP address will be then <b>thisusername@dukgo.com</b>. As domain of course you must set <b>dukgo.com</b> :-). The resource can actually be empty, its an optional value which "defines" your instance of the pidgin for others, if you have several locations you chat from. Now you can choose a password, which you also directly can store, so that you don't need to remember it. The values under User Options are totally locally and only for the tuning of the user.</p>

<p>If you don't have any account on our community platform yet, then it is important that you hit the small "Create this new account on the server" checkbox! If you are just using your already existing account on our community platform, the checkbox must be off!</p>

<p>Then hit "Add" to get to the next step:</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/3_acceptcert.png" class="block mid" alt="Accepting certificate of dukgo.com" />

<p>Now you need to accept our certificate. So far we use a self-signed certificate which doesn't approve anything for you. But this service is also in Beta, so we will see what changes here in the future. Just hit the "Accept" button, so that it can go on. There are also other windows now open on your screen, but we come to them later.</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/4_register.png" class="block mid" alt="Register new XMPP account" />

<p>After you accepted the certification you then can instantly approve the registration you wanted. Its all prefilled, so you just hit the "Register" button to go on.</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/5_regsuccess.png" class="block mid" alt="Registration successful" />

<p>Yeah you did it! :-) Don't forget your pw! :-) Now you actually need todo a bit more to use the account :)</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/6_activateaccount.png" class="block mid" alt="Account list" />

<p>You need to actually enable your account on this window, which should still be open for you. Just hit the small checkbox on the enabled row to activate your account like seen on the screenshot!</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/7_addchatbuddy.png" class="block mid" alt="Adding chat or buddy menu points" />

<p>Now you can go and "Add Buddy" or "Add Chat" to get more out of the XMPP experience :-)</p>

<p>For example you can now add the DuckDuckGo Instant Messenger bot as your friend:</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/8_addduckduckgobot.png" class="block mid" alt="Adding im@ddg.gg DukDuckGo chat" />

<p>Then you got him in your buddy list and you can click on him write him something to get something like this:</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/9_duckduckgobottest.png" class="block mid" alt="First chat with DuckDuckGo Bot" />

<p>You can also "Add Chat" to add our DuckDuckGo Jabber Conference, it will soon  be linked to the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=duckduckgo">IRC channel #duckduckgo on freenode</a>, but we welcome everybody already now :-). Of course you can "Autojoin" if you want :-)</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog/pidgin_xmpp/A_addchat.png" class="block mid" alt="Adding DuckDuckGo conference room" />

<p>So I hope you find this interesting and also ask your friends to play around with XMPP and Jabber, its generally the only way to get instant messaging with your friends without tracking of a central service, but still with secured usernames.</p>

<p>My personal jabber is: <b>getty@dukgo.com</b> so that you can also add me and ask me out about it :)</p>

<h3>Thanks for using our XMPP services :-)</h3>
