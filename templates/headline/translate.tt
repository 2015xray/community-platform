  <p>Here you can translate the different text snippets of our sites. It's a very easy process, by choosing the project part you want to translate you get to a list of all existing text snippets, which you can translate step by step into your language, you can choose on the top right of the page. You can see existing translations on the right, important is here, that you don't need to give the same translation again, this would not be helpful and just increase your own work.</p>

  <p>Please also vote on the translation for your language! You have the option to vote for the translation alternative to translate the token yourself. By default we only show you totally untranslated tokens (if there exist some), but you got a button there to see all tokens.</p>
